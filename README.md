## Introduction
In this cybersecurity bootcamp project, I built and hosted a secure "cyber-blog" web application using Microsoft Azure. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in various aspects of cybersecurity, including Keyvaults, App Services, Front Door, WAF}
PHP, HTML, Docker, OpenSSL. The project has been developed with security in mind, incorporating a range of security features to protect the web application from potential threats.

## Technologies Used
- Azure: {Keyvaults, App Services, Front Door, WAF}
- PHP, HTML
- Docker
- OpenSSL
- GoDaddy/Azure (mention which one you used for domain registration)

## Problem and Solution
(Here, describe the problem your project addresses and how your solution tackles that problem. Mention any challenges you faced during the development and how you overcame them.)

## Project Components
### Azure Cloud Services
(Explain how you used Azure Cloud Services to host your web application, and the benefits of using this technology.)

### Docker Container
(Describe how you deployed a Docker container with a blog webpage framework, and how you customized the webpage by SSHing into the container.)

### SSL Certificates
(Explain the process of creating a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL, storing it in Azure Key Vault, and binding it to your website. Also, discuss the security issues associated with self-signed certificates and how you switched to a managed CA-approved certificate.)

### WAF Rules and Security Center
(Discuss how you deployed Azure Front Door, configured WAF rules to restrict traffic from certain countries, and analyzed Azure Security Center recommendations to apply the necessary fixes.)

## Live Demo
(Provide a link to the live demo of your cyber-blog web application if you have one hosted on a public domain.)

## Installation and Usage
(Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run your project, making it easy for potential employers to test your application.)

## Security Features
(Highlight the security measures you've implemented in your project, such as SSL certificates, Azure security features, and WAF rules.)

## Learnings
(Share your key takeaways from the project, including what you've learned about systems administration, networking, network security, cryptography, virtualization, cloud deployment, and web development.)

## License
(Include the license information for your project, specifying how potential employers can use and modify your code.)
